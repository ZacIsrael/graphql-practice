What is GraphQL?
- provides another way of querying servers for data
- specifies how the front end should talk to backend APIs
- specifies how bakcend APIs should be built in order to 
respond to GraphQl messages
- GraphQL is a language used for querying (hence QL = query language)
- Simpler than restful APIs because only one endpoint is needed 
- The one endpoint (/graphql) is a post request where teh body contains the query
- queries: asks the server for data
- mutations: modify data 
- the structure of the response is flexible, the query defines exactly which data is returned in the response 


Practice queries here: https://graphql.org/swapi-graphql

sample query that retrieves the title and release date of the film where the filmId = 1:
query {
  film(filmID: 1){
    title
    releaseDate
  }
}

GraphQL vs REST:

- these two can work alongside eachother 

GraphQL:
- perfect for ecommerce applications 
- solves the issues of underfetching (not getting enough data in the response) 
& overfetching (getting more data than necessary in the response)
- saves bandwidth
- saves develoeprs from doing extra processing work
- more efficient  
- gives the devloper schemas and types 
- speeds up development, great for large scale projects 
- only has one endpoint to access the entire backend 

REST:
- stateless, allows developers to create clusters and scale servers easily
- has named endpoints that are easy to navigate 
- follows HTTP protocol very closely 
- easier to cache frequently requested data
- more common 

What is a RESTful API?
- A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface 
(API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and 
allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for representational 
state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding

What is GraphQL Tools?
- https://www.graphql-tools.com/
- GraphQL Tools is a set of NPM packages and an opinionated structure for how 
to build a GraphQL schema and resolvers in JavaScript, following the GraphQL-first 
development workflow
- has been proven to work in many production applications 

Wha are the two large components that every GraphQL server has?
- schemas:
  - describes the shape of the available data 
  - defines a hierarchy of types with fields that are populated from back-end data stores
  - specifies exactly which queries and mutations are available for clients to execute
- resolvers:
  - a collection of functions that generate response for a GraphQL query
  - acts as a GraphQL query handler
  - Every resolver function in a GraphQL schema accepts four positional arguments as given below:
    - fieldName:(root, args, context, info) => { result }
  - resolver parameters:
    - parent: the root object (when just starting out)
    - args: used when there is a parameterized query (filtering products based on a condition)
    - context: useful for data that is shared across all the resolvers (authentication data, etc)
    - info: contains information about the current state of the operation  
  - can make API calls, asynchronous database operations, and comnine differnet data or filter it 

What are the two main operations that GraphQL servers support?
- queries: used to fetch server-side data 
- mutations: used to modify server-side data
